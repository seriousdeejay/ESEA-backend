      Consider implementing a living wage policy pegged to the costs of living in your area. For more information and resources on how to implement a living wage policy, please visit: http://www.livingwage.org.uk/sites/default/files/BAR_LivingWageReport%20cropped%2021%2001.pdf
      If interested in supporting the development of Living Wage calculations for your area or your industry, see the Global Living Wage Coalition. http://www.isealalliance.org/our-work/improving-effectiveness/global-living-wage-coalition
      A living wage goes beyond meeting the minimum wage required by law and ensures that employees have the money necessary to meet living expenses in your region.
      By implementing a living wage policy, businesses can reduce staff turnover, increase workers' morale and loyalty, reduce absenteeism, increase productivity, and strengthen recruitment.

      This question measures the extent to which a business maintains equity in salaries among its highest- and lowest-earning employees. Income equity is an indicator that wealth is distributed throughout the business so that as a business excels, all of its employees reap the benefits.
      
      Lower pay ratios can increase both workers' and consumers' perception of a company. According to a Harvard Business Review study called Paying Up for Fair Pay, consumers prefer buying from companies with low pay ratios. Research shows when consumers learn of a business's high pay ratio (e.g., 1000 to 1), it reduces purchase intention relative to firms with lower ratios (e.g., 5 to 1). Lower pay ratios improve consumer perceptions across a range of products at different price points, and increase consumer ratings of both firm warmth and firm competence. http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/15-091/eb472863-c73b-4aca-a8ee-d7dc1748a91d.pdf
      
      To manage the multiple of pay from highest to lowest, consider creating policies that link pay increases for executives with pay increases with for other employees. If your company has an advisory body that oversees executive compensation, consider discussing with them.

      This question rewards businesses that protect the well-being and financial security of their employees by providing benefits that go beyond health insurance. These benefits will reduce the cost of essential services to employees and their families, and protect the employee and their family in the event of accident.
      
      Going above and beyond the benefits offered or mandated by government programs can provide higher quality or broader coverage for employees to protect their financial stability, health, and wellness.
      
      Employees that have access to benefits which keep them healthy and well are less likely to miss work, and can increase company loyalty and productivity.
      
      Consider speaking with employees to understand better what kind of supplemental benefits they would be interested in. This could be done via survey or conversationally.
      
      Consider reviewing the programs provided or required by the government and speaking with employees about potential supplements that would be most valuable to them.

      Paid time off promotes the personal well-being of employees, giving them opportunities to take care of family members, balance work and family obligations, pursue personal interests, and rest or recover from sickness.
      
      Leave, whether paid or unpaid, can have a positive effect on long-term productivity by improving recruitment, retention, and employee motivation.

      Providing regular formal performance promotes career development and personal growth for employees, who are able to continuously refer back to suggestions and track their development over time.
      
      Performance feedback provides employees with a clear understanding of how they are doing, what is working, and what isn't working. It provides a mechanism for identifying areas for improvement regarding task execution and work style, and increases clarity around performance and role-related expectations.
      
      Consider what feedback structure would be appropriate for your company and employees. Here is a one-pager on structuring performance feedback from MIT Human Resources: http://hrweb.mit.edu/performance-development/performance-reviews/preparing-and-conducting-annual-performance-review
      Here's another one-page from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/monitoring/feedback-is-critical-to-improving-performance/

          This question is used to determine the set of questions that your company will see in reference to their employee impact. The nature of the majority of a company's employment is very important for determining the type of impact the company has and for establishing best practices. Salaried employees are those workers that recieve a fixed amount of pay for regular work that is not dependent upon the time worked. This is usually quantified on an annual or monthly basis. Daily/hourly employees are those that are paid dependent upon the amount of time worked, and are either contracted on a daily basis or or paid for the amount of hours worked in a given time period. If workers punch a time card, and get paid overtime when working extra hours, consider them as hourly paid. For the purposes of this question, please count workers on a headcount basis instead of on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis. Only include payrolled employees and exclude independent contractors and interns in your calculation.

          To find if a Living Wage calculation is available for your country and learn more about the Living Wage methodology visit the Global Living Wage Coalition (https://www.globallivingwage.org)
          The living wage is defined as the wage a full-time worker would need to earn to support a family above the federal poverty line in a given locality.
          Identify your lowest paid wage and compare it to a recognized third-party living wage standard, such as those identified below.
          In the United States, please use the MIT Living Wage Calculator to find the appropriate wage based on the local cost of living: http://livingwage.mit.edu (use wage rate for one adult). For example, the living wage for New York City in 2016 according to this calculator is $14.30/hour.
          
          To access Canada's Living Wage calculator, please visit: http://www.livingwageforfamilies.ca/employers/living-wage-calculator/
          For Vancouver, Manitoba Kingston and Toronto see Page 15.
          For the UK living wage rate, please visit: http://www.livingwage.org.uk/calculation
          Importantly, calculations of living wages in your region may vary, particularly if your local government has specified a different wage in contracting policies. B Lab will review different methodologies for potential inclusion for this question. For many countries a living wage that meets equivalent standards as the ones above have not been developed. In those cases, select N/A.

          This calculation is inclusive of sick days, holidays, personal days, and vacation days etc., and should be calculated at the minimum number of days available for a tenured employee. Please include all leave regardless of whether the company voluntarily offers it or government requires it. For example, New York City requires employers to provide 5 days of paid sick leave annually; therefore, if your company is located in NYC, you may count at least 5 days toward this question. Do not double count, however - i.e. if an NYC company offers employees 10 paid days of sick leave, it would count as 10 days of sick leave, not 15 (15=10 provided by the company and 5 required by NYC). If your company has an informal policy with no specifically-stated sick day allowance, and workers are directed to take sick days as needed, please count 5 days in your sum for this question. (This is used as a reasonable estimate of the amount actually taken, as it can not be precisely verified.) If your company allows unlimited vacation days, please count 10 days in your sum for this question regarding vacation, but also factor in holidays, sick days, and others.

Unlimited is defined by the quality and quantity of work that the employee is submitting to the company. As long as the work is there, you are free to come and go as you please, responsibly. All part time or hourly workers are allotted 10 days of paid vacation annually for the first 2 years, after that they are allowed 21 days of paid vacation annually. All vacation needs to be calendared at least 3 weeks in advance and noted on the company calendar for reference. The company asks that employees exercise personal responsibility regarding paid time off to support and maintain our flexible and compassionate culture.
